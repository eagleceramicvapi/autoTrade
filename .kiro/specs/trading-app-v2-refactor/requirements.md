# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the existing monolithic trading application into a clean, modular v2 architecture. The goal is to restructure the codebase without changing functionality, creating a maintainable and scalable architecture that separates concerns and improves code organization.

## Glossary

- **Trading_Application**: The Flask-based trading dashboard system for CE/PE options trading
- **Monolithic_Architecture**: Current single-file structure where all functionality exists in app.py
- **Modular_Architecture**: Target architecture with separated concerns and organized modules
- **API_Layer**: RESTful endpoints for frontend-backend communication
- **Business_Logic**: Core trading algorithms and market data processing
- **Data_Layer**: Database operations and data persistence
- **Configuration_Manager**: System for managing application settings and parameters
- **Authentication_System**: OAuth2 and TOTP-based user authentication
- **Trading_Engine**: Core component handling trading strategies and order execution
- **Market_Data_Service**: Component responsible for fetching and processing market data
- **Alert_Manager**: System for managing and displaying user notifications

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to be restructured into logical modules, so that I can easily maintain and extend the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Trading_Application SHALL be organized into separate modules for different concerns
2. THE Trading_Application SHALL maintain all existing functionality without modification
3. THE Trading_Application SHALL use a clear directory structure that separates API, business logic, and data layers
4. THE Trading_Application SHALL implement proper dependency injection between modules
5. THE Trading_Application SHALL maintain the same external API interface for frontend compatibility

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the trading engine to be separated from the web framework, so that I can test and modify trading logic independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Trading_Engine SHALL be implemented as a standalone service class
2. THE Trading_Engine SHALL handle all trading strategy execution and position management
3. THE Trading_Engine SHALL be decoupled from Flask routing and HTTP concerns
4. THE Trading_Engine SHALL maintain all existing trading algorithms and logic
5. THE Trading_Engine SHALL provide clear interfaces for order placement and position tracking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want market data operations to be centralized, so that I can manage data fetching and processing efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Market_Data_Service SHALL handle all external API calls for market data
2. THE Market_Data_Service SHALL manage scrip master data and updates
3. THE Market_Data_Service SHALL provide caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
4. THE Market_Data_Service SHALL handle LTP fetching and index data retrieval
5. THE Market_Data_Service SHALL maintain data validation and error handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration management to be centralized, so that I can easily modify application settings without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL load settings from external configuration files
2. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL provide validation for configuration parameters
3. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL support environment-specific configurations
4. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL maintain backward compatibility with existing settings
5. THE Configuration_Manager SHALL provide runtime configuration updates where appropriate

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want authentication and authorization to be modularized, so that I can maintain security features independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Authentication_System SHALL handle OAuth2 flow and token management
2. THE Authentication_System SHALL manage TOTP generation and validation
3. THE Authentication_System SHALL provide session management capabilities
4. THE Authentication_System SHALL maintain all existing security features
5. THE Authentication_System SHALL be easily testable and maintainable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the API layer to be clearly separated from business logic, so that I can modify endpoints without affecting core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE API_Layer SHALL contain only HTTP routing and request/response handling
2. THE API_Layer SHALL delegate all business logic to appropriate service classes
3. THE API_Layer SHALL maintain RESTful conventions and existing endpoint contracts
4. THE API_Layer SHALL handle input validation and error responses
5. THE API_Layer SHALL provide proper HTTP status codes and response formatting

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want data persistence to be abstracted, so that I can modify storage mechanisms without affecting business logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Data_Layer SHALL abstract all file operations and data persistence
2. THE Data_Layer SHALL provide repository patterns for data access
3. THE Data_Layer SHALL handle CSV file operations and order history management
4. THE Data_Layer SHALL maintain data integrity and validation
5. THE Data_Layer SHALL support easy migration to different storage backends

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the alert system to be modularized, so that I can extend notification capabilities independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Alert_Manager SHALL handle all alert creation and management
2. THE Alert_Manager SHALL provide different alert types and severity levels
3. THE Alert_Manager SHALL maintain alert history and read status
4. THE Alert_Manager SHALL be decoupled from specific delivery mechanisms
5. THE Alert_Manager SHALL support extensible alert formatting and filtering
